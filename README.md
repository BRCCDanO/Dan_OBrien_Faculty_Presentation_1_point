# Faculty Presentation for Dan OBrien, March 27, 2023
### Files
Point code in Java consists of main and point programs in /src
### Introduction
Welcome to my faculty presentation on Java programming, featuring concepts previously covered along with new working demonstrations
### Step by step functionality
This program first creates a Point class in Java with x and y values

Then, five Point objects are created in main(), after which the objects are added to an ArrayList

Next, the program iterates through the list with a for loop and each x and y value are printed using the get functions

In addition, a plot graph is created

The Point class has a no-argument constructor that sets the x and y to zero

And a second constructor takes the x and y values as arguments
